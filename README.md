# AFL-Almanac-B
Aims:
 - To leverage our large archive of match/event footage and create a product that:			
 - Has commercial value (can be monetised through fees, sponsorship, advertising, etc);			
 - Increases engagement and drives audience growth across 5-12 year olds.			
Description: 
 - We have a large archive of analogue AFL content, so would like to explore and test product ideas that 
 could come from digitising our back catalogue and stats of the game.
 - We have StatsPro (http://www.afl.com.au/stats/stats-pro#/) with data and vision from games in 2017 onwards, allowing to compare players and see highlights from each game. What could we do with all the analogue tapes we have in our library (we are looking at options with vendors like Google, AWS how to digitise at scale), so we like to explore what the digitised product can look like for fans and whatâ€™s the commercial model that underpins it
Deliverables: 
- Working prototype that shows a commercially-viable product; 
- Presentation showing the potential business models and how it fits with the Telstra product set including AFL Live Pass; 
- Incorporates feedback from fans on willingness to pay, price points, and inclusions, etc; 
- Evidence-based approach to increasing engagement across 5-12 year olds through the proposed product; 
- Risks/Issues/Dependencies/Constraints relating to development of the proposed product;
- Next steps.
